# Bootcamp Prework Study Guide Application

## Description 

This application was created to help organize the important notes taken throughout the Prework modules. It is a place where one can easily access the notes in an organized fashion. Since it is categorized and on one page, it allows for a more efficient way to study whichever topic you please. We used the console to be able to test our application and coded it to be interactive by having it suggest what topic to study at random. Building this application was a also a way to personalize my own study guide. Using CSS allowed me to change the color of the banners to my favorite color which makes it more aesthetically pleasing to me. I was also able to write the notes in a way that is easy for me to understand. One of the biggest challenges I overcame and learned from was using the Command Line and learning what commands to enter. Creating an SSH key was also more challenging. I plan to add more notes to this study guide and more interactivity.
